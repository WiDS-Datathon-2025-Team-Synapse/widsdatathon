## üí°Project Overview
As fellows in the Break Through Tech AI Program, we participated in the WiDS Datathon 2025 on Kaggle. The WiDS Datathon Global Challenge was developed in partnership with the Ann S. Bowers Women‚Äôs Brain Health Initiative (WBHI), Cornell University, and UC Santa Barbara. The datasets and support are provided by the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), the signature scientific initiative of the Child Mind Institute, and the Reproducible Brain Charts project (RBC). This challenge provides a valuable opportunity to strengthen our data science skills while tackling an interesting and critical social impact challenge!

### Objective
The goal of the competition is to develop a predictive model that accurately predicts both an individual‚Äôs sex and their ADHD diagnosis using functional brain imaging data of children and adolescents and their socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information. The challenge lies in handling complex, potentially imbalanced datasets and extracting meaningful patterns that improve prediction accuracy.

### Real World Significance
ADHD has historically been underdiagnosed and understudied in females, contributing to gaps in care and support. It affects approximately 11% of adolescents, with around 14% of boys and 8% of girls receiving a diagnosis. However, evidence suggests that girls with ADHD are often overlooked because they tend to exhibit more inattentive symptoms, which are harder to detect. As a result, undiagnosed girls may continue to struggle with symptoms that burden their mental health and daily functioning. Machine learning models capable of predicting ADHD and identifying gender-specific patterns could improve early detection, particularly in females, where diagnosis is more challenging. Additionally, these models can provide insights into the brain mechanisms underlying ADHD in both males and females, paving the way for more targeted and effective personalized treatments. Early identification and tailored therapies could significantly enhance mental health outcomes for individuals with ADHD.
